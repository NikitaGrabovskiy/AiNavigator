	Work on first 2 steps in parallel

	1) Create a website (Which will look good and contain an information about all the AI available tools)

	2) Create a YouTube channel to promote the website (It should contain latest news on AI(Not too technical) and description on how to use existing available services)

	3) After it is done - and I got some views and traffic - ask Andrea, Andrey and Maks to work together on the project (Mask earlier)
